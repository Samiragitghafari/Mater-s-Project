#Even though Adaptive thermal comfort theory has long been introduced and supported, the familiar comfort analyzing tools still use the statistical methods. In essence, adaptive comfort theory could not be formalized. This theory is included in psychological, biological, and cultural issues that could not be combined in formulas, which could be why. In this research, a 'thermal comfort prediction tool' has been developed. This tool is designed based on ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) using the ASHRAE global thermal comfort database II. An online, open-source database includes approximately 81,846 complete sets of objective indoor climatic observations accompanying "right-here-right-now" subjective evaluations by the building occupants exposed to them. This tool is comparable with the CBE ASHRAE THERMAL COMFORT TOOL, a web-based interactive visualization engine for the database, which is a white-box model. It can predict that a thermal environment is cold, warm, or it is in comfort with 70% accuracy.
